0,What is coronavirus?,"Coronavirus is not a single virus, but a family of at least 23 related viruses, further subdivided into four groups. Till date, just six of the coronaviruses are known to infect humans, including the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The new 2019-nCov is a new form of the coronavirus capable of infecting humans."
1,What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-2019) is the official name assigned to the novel coronavirus disease under commonly agreed guidelines between WHO, the World Organisation for Animal Health, and the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the UN. It was earlier being called 2019-nCoV."
2,What are the causes of coronavirus?,Coronaviruses are highly contagious and can spread from person to person. Some coronaviruses are found only in animals but may evolve to cause infection in humans. Such viruses are called zoonotic.
3,What are coronavirus symptoms in humans?,"Coronaviruses normally cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infection. The symptoms are mostly similar to common flu such as headache, runny nose, cough, fever and sore throat. In some people with compromised immunity, infants, and elderly people, it can cause lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis."
4,What is the most severe complication of COVID-19?,One of the most severe complications in patients infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is pneumonia in both lungs.
5,What is the incubation period for coronavirus?,"Coronavirus attacks the respiratory tract through the nasal passage and shows signs and symptoms similar to common flu after the incubation period of about three days. The incubation period is up to 14 days. A study by Chinese researchers led by Nan-Shan Zhong, an epidemiologist and pulmonologist who discovered the SARS coronavirus in 2003, however found that the incubation period can be up to 24 days."
6,What is R0 being discussed among epidemiologists about coronavirus?,"R0 is a basic reproduction number that refers to a contagious individual who can infect other people when exposed to a susceptible population. It determines the infecting capability of the disease. The R0 for coronavirus is approximately 2.2, which is considered high for the disease. It is, however, not the only parameter to be considered to measure the intensity of an outbreak."
7,Who are at the highest risk of getting infected with coronavirus?,"Elderly people with underlying conditions are at the most risk of getting coronavirus infection. Many of those infected with the 2019-nCoV died due to multi-organ failure not directly because of the virus but due to the impact and shock that the virus caused on the body generally. Many patients can, therefore, survive if provided with adequate support and care."
8,Is coronavirus deadly?,"The COVID-19 has claimed more than a thousand lives globally after its outbreak in Wuhan, China. The disease, although, can’t be termed as deadly based on the current death toll, the intensity may increase before a treatment is available."
9,Is coronavirus worse than Ebola?,"Ebola virus disease was a global epidemic that emerged between 2013 and 2016. It has an average fatality rate of about 50%, whereas the fatality rate of the 2019-nCoV epidemic is less than 3%."
10,What is the intensity of the coronavirus disease in the affected people?,"Approximately 80% of the reported COVID-19 cases have mild disease, 15% have severe disease, mostly pneumonia that requires hospitalisation, and between 3% and 5% will need intensive care."
11,Can the coronavirus survive better indoor?,"Yes, according to Tan Chorh Chuan, Chief Health Scientist in Singapore, the likelihood of survival of coronavirus is more indoor than outdoor. People should, therefore, switch off air-conditioner and breathe in fresh air to reduce the risk of infection, advised Tan Chorh Chuan."
12,Does the novel coronavirus affect children?,"The exact way in which the COVID-19 virus affects children is unknown. Reports of children being diagnosed with the disease, however, have emerged although no fatalities have been reported."
13,What is the cure for coronavirus?,"No specified treatment exists for coronavirus infection to date, except in China, which recently approved the use of an anti viral drug called Favilavir. People may get better with proper rest and care. Symptomatic relief can be provided by over-the-counter (OTC) fever, cough, flu, and pain-relieving drugs and proper hydration of the body by sufficient intake of fluids."
14,Can any existing treatments cure coronavirus?,"Certain antiretroviral drugs are being studied for the potential treatment of the infection. Fapilavir, an antiviral drug, was recently approved for the treatment of coronavirus by China, following a clinical trial in 70 patients. Researchers are also working to develop vaccines to develop immunity against the coronavirus."
15,What is the treatment given to the coronavirus-infected patients currently?,"Current standard of care for coronavirus depends on the severity of the disease. Symptomatic treatment is being provided in mild cases. Cases with more severe condition require treatment with optimised supportive care such as oxygen therapy and close monitoring. For patients with severe infection, delivery of intensive care such as safe mechanical ventilation and resuscitation is indicated."
16,Can HIV drugs cure coronavirus?,HIV drugs such as Kaletra and LOPIMUNE (lopinavir and ritonavir) that are approved protease inhibitors are being repurposed to potentially treat the coronavirus infection.
17,Are two anti-HIV drugs of J&J and AbbVie being repurposed for coronavirus?,"Currently, there are no proven therapeutics for coronavirus and the existing drugs are being tested for their activity against the virus and can be used off-label or for compassionate use or in clinical trial on higher regulatory and ethical standards. These drugs are also part of other protocols that are used for MERS-CoV, but they are not approved and are in research stage."
18,What is the antiviral drug being tested for COVID-19 in China?,China is carrying out randomised clinical trials on Gilead's remdesivir and expects result shortly.
19,What are the vaccines available for coroanvirus?,"No vaccines have been approved for coronavirus as yet, while few are being studied for development."
20,What care should new mothers infected with coronavirus take?,Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission from mother to infant during feeding through respiratory droplets and direct contact. UNICEF recommends the feeding mothers to wear a mask while feeding and wash hands before and after feedings. Care should also be taken to avoid spreading of infection indirectly through contaminated surfaces by regularly cleaning and disinfecting the surfaces. Mothers who are too ill are advised to express milk and feed the child through a clean cup or spoon rather than breast feeding.
21,Is it safe for a coronavirus-infected mother to breastfeed?,No report on the effect of COVID-19 on breast milk is available currently. The UNICEF recommends coronavirus-infected mothers to breastfeed after consulting with healthcare providers to understand the unknown risks.

23,How is coronavirus diagnosed?,Laboratory testing on respiratory specimens and serum of the patient are used by healthcare professionals for the diagnosis of coronavirus in humans.
24,What are the diagnostic tests available for coronavirus detection?,"The coronavirus is tested for by PCR, which was initially available in Atlanta, US, through CDC, but now has been made available globally. The CDC is shipping laboratory test kits for 2019-nCoV to global laboratories for detecting the virus."
25,Is the coronavirus diagnostic test FDA-approved?,"Yes. The CDC developed a real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test for the 2019-nCoV diagnosis, using respiratory and serum samples. An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) package was submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration for the test by the CDC, which was approved on 4 February 2020."
26,How are the CDC coronavirus test kits being made available globally?,The CDC’s rRT-PCR diagnostic test is being distributed to qualified domestic public health laboratories and to international public health partners through International Reagent Resource (IRR).
27,How is the WHO helping in diagnosis of coronavirus globally?,"The WHO has shipped 250,000 test kits to more than 159 reference laboratories globally to facilitate faster diagnosis and research, as of early-February."
28,Where can I get tested for coronavirus?,Public Health Authorities across many countries have announced designated laboratories where diagnostic test kits have been made available for performing coronavirus tests.
29,Can COVID-19 diagnosis be performed in the Caribbean countries?,"Yes, the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) is equipping laboratories and training lab specialists in eight Caribbean regions for the COVID-19 diagnosis. The countries are Suriname, Barbados, Haiti, Jamaica, Belize, Dominica, Bahamas, and Guyana."
30,How is coronavirus diagnosed in countries without testing facility?,"The countries with no testing capability send the samples to COVID-19 referral laboratories designated by World Health Organisation (WHO) for testing. For rapid and free-of-cost samples shipment, WHO is utilising Shipping Fund Project established by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)."
31,How is coronavirus transmitted or spread?,"Similar to other respiratory infections, the most common way of coronavirus transmission is respiratory droplets, which are fluids particles that are generated by coughing and sneezing of an individual. Such droplets contain the virus present in the respiratory lining of an infected individual. These particles do not stay for long in air but in case of air-borne disease transmission, the virus particles remain in air for some time and can infect the other person sharing the space. It is still not clear whether coronavirus can be air-borne or not. CDC, therefore, recommends healthcare workers to use N95 respirator masks, while treating coronavirus patients."
32,Can posts and packages coming from China transmit coronavirus?,"No, WHO says, coronavirus can’t survive for very long on inanimate objects under variable temperature and route and, hence, people receiving posts and packages from China are not at risk of contracting the coronavirus."
33,Can coronavirus spread from dogs or cats to humans?,No evidence exists currently to prove that the novel coronavirus (nCoV) can spread from pet animals such as dogs and cats to humans.
34,Can coronavirus spread through eyes?,"Yes, coronavirus can enter the body through eyes, when an infected touches them. Avoiding direct contact with the infected is, therefore, suggested."
35,Can goggles protect you from catching the new coronavirus?,Wearing goggles can prevent the eyes from catching thecoronavirus when an infected touches them.
36,Can coronavirus be transmitted from mother to foetus in a pregnant?,"No, according to a study performed in nine pregnant women in Wuhan. No case of vertical transmission of coronavirus from pregnant women in their third trimester to their foetus has been reported so far."
37,When did the novel coronavirus outbreak occur?,"The novel coronavirus outbreak originated in the Wuhan city, China, towards the end of 2019."
