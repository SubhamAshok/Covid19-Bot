** NOTE: This project was created for educational purpose

Follow the instructions to run the program:-
1. Download and unzip the folder 
2. Run the *main.ipynb* in your jupyter notebook 

** NOTE: If you are a developer and interested in the code and the procedure of development, I would recommend that you move to basefiles directory and view the files rather than the modified dummies on main directory.
